- I could ( I guess ) figure out what is applied within sklearn linear regression model, it is the Standardization ( Z Standardization ) with 10k iterations and a learning rate of 0.01
- Stochastic gradient descent needs a smaller learning rate and much much much more time than Batch Gradient descent to achieve relatively the same results
